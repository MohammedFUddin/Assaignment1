        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! I am Adelle Davis and i am a nutritionist in.I believed many of America's dietary problems were due to
            most doctors not being well informed about nutrition. I believed few medical schools offered nutrition
            courses and physicians had little time to read the hundreds of medical journals published to keep up with
            new findings. I also criticized the food industry of helping promote bad eating habits with misleading
            advertising.
